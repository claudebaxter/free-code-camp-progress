/*
A linked list is a linear data structure similar to an array. However, unlike arrays, elements are not stored in a particular memory location or index. Rather each element is a separate object that contains a pointer or a link to the next object in that list.

Each element (commonly called nodes) contains two items: the data stored and a link to the next node. The data can be any valid data type. You can see this illustrated in the diagram below:

Head
\/
[6][-]-->[10][-]-->[12]-]-->[3][-]--> null

Image of a linked list
The entry point to a linked list is called the head. The head is a reference to the first node in the linked list. The last node on the list points to null. If a list is empty, the head is a null reference.

In JavaScript, a linked list looks like this: */

const list = {
    head: {
        value: 6
        next: {
            value: 10                                             
            next: {
                value: 12
                next: {
                    value: 3
                    next: null	
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
