          Here you can see a "spook," or ghost of the mind, rendered on your very screen. This is an illusion produced via the work of multiple human minds over time to create memes about Max Stirner.

        <h1>Max Stirner Quotes</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "The men of the future will yet fight their way to many a liberty that we do not even miss."
          </li>
          <li>
            "The state calls its own violence law, but that of the individual crime."
          </li>
          <li>
            "Crimes spring from fixed ideas."
          </li>
          <li>
            "Atheists are pious people."
          </li>
          <li>
            "The labourers have the most enormous power in their hands, and, if they once became thoroughly conscious of it and used it, nothing would withstand them; they would only have to stop labour, regard the product of labour as theirs, and enjoy it. This is the sense of the labour disturbances which show themselves here and there."
          </li>
          <li>
            "The state rests on the slavery of labour. If labour becomes free, the state is lost."
          </li>
        </ul>
