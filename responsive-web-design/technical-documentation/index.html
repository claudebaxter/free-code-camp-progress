        <p>Dark Coin is an experimental grassroots community project to develop and expand the Algorand DEFI ecosystem. Dark Coin is managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning that the project is collectively owned / managed by its users based on specific rules enforced by the blockchain and smart contracts.</p>

        <p>There is no guarantee or promise made from the creator / developers that this project will make investors money. There is no guarantee or promise regarding the direction of the price action of the Dark Coin token.</p>

        <p>Investing is always a risk. Anyone considering investing in this project, or crypto in general, should conduct thorough research and consider seeking guidance from a financial advisor. Never invest money that you cannot afford to lose.</p>

          <p>The Dark Coin team is developing a browser based DAPP that will be accessed via our website, https://dark-coin.io. Our users will be able to send and receive private transactions on the Algorand network.</p>

          <p>Being a DAO, the users of our dapp will also be able to use a governance protocol to make decisions on the projects direction/future. Our governance dApp will allow users to cast votes and submit proposals using NFT voting tokens.</p>

        <p>Dark Coin was minted on the Algorand blockchain Saturday, February 12, 2022, with a total supply of 500,000,000 tokens.</p>

        <p>400,000,000 Dark Coin was transferred from the creator wallet to create the liquidity pool on Tinyman so that users can exchange the asset, and can contribute additional liquidity to the pool to support the project. The LP tokens received for this have been locked through May 31, 2022, on Tinylock. Because we intend to keep this liquidity locked permanently, a new vote will be held before the end of May 2023 for the community to decide if we should continue to stay locked with Tinylock, or use another service, and for how long. This is simply to ensure that we are locking the liquidity in a way that is secure and responsible.</p>

        <p>Users who locked in 5,000,000 Dark Coin by February 19, 2022 are provided with an initial early backer reward of 1,000,000 Dark Coin. The early backer program has concluded, and we are keeping this information in the darkpaper for transparency.</p>

        <p>The remaining 100,000,000 tokens in the creator / developer wallets are used to disburse the early backer air drop, as well as future air drops & contest rewards the community decides to distribute (e.g., rewards to users for our logo contest). This will also be used to partner with other developers to help fund the development costs.</p>

        <p>Profits earned from NFT Sales from the creator wallet will be split between providing liquidity and the Marketing & Development wallet.</p>

        <p>Both the Creator and Developer Wallet 2 will not sell or transfer any of the initial 100,000,000 Dark Coin without disclosing details to the community for approval, as these funds are to be used to provide additional liquidity, as well as fund and promote the project as it expands.</p>

        <p>Please be aware that dates listed may changed based on ever changing circumstances.</p>
        <p>Goal 1: Produce a functioning closed beta by September 30, 2022--this has been completed.</p>
        <p>Goal 2: Partnering with developers by April 30, 2022--took a bit longer than expected, but we have partnered with Anders who has produced the open functioning beta for our DAO Voting App!</p>
        <p>Goal 3: Expand moderation and marketing teams--currently, we have sufficient manpower for marketing and moderation efforts.</p>
        <p>Goal 4: Listings--Efforts are ongoing to get the Dark Coin project listed across all possible channels.</p>
        <p>Goal 5: Verifications--We have successfully been verified by the Pera and AlgoExplorer teams!</p>
        <p>Goal 6: Grants & Funding--At this time we have not been awarded any grants or significant amounts of funding. The project is currently funded out of pocket by the team, and utilizes 50% of NFT profits for project expenses.</p>
