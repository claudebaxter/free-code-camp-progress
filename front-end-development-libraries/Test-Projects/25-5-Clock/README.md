# FCC 25-5 Clock

This is my submission for the freecodecamp.org 25-5 Clock Challenge.

To see the passing project you'll have to check out the <a href=https://codepen.io/elborracho420/full/vYaevXP title="FCC 25 + 5 Clock">codepen here.</a> Unfortunately I had to take out font awesome so the buttons don't look as good but it passes the tests!

To view the 25-5 Clock built with react using state hooks, click<a href=https://25-5-clock-eight.vercel.app/ title="FCC 25 + 5 Clock"> here.</a> For some reason I could not get this version to pass even though it was built with React 17. If I figure out the reason I'll update this note.
